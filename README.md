<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**Lycans** is a school project created by our team, Pagaloma Studio. It is a 3D First-Person Strategy Game, inspired by among us, the werewolves game, and multiple Minecraft "Mumble" UHC gamemodes. 
The players are dispatched into two teams : Villagers and Werewolves. The main goal of villagers is to eliminate all the werewolves before getting killed. The werewolves have to kill everybody, without acting suspicious.
On the day, all the players can vote against the person they find the most suspect. On the night, werewolves can take their actual form, and devour villagers.

A game is over when an entire team has been eliminated.

To balance the game, some villagers have special powers : 
- The Priest, who can give immortality to a player during a night
- The Seer, who can reveal the role of the player of her choice
- The Spy, who can turn invisible during 25seconds
- The Lycan, who is marked as werewolf if observed by the seer

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This part is a guide to install Lycans on your computer.

### Prerequisites

Currently, Lycans is not built for Linux or MacOS system. You will need a computer using Windows 7 or above. However, an installer for debian is currently in development. 

### Installation

Here are the steps to follow if you want to install Lycans :

1. [Download](https://github.com/Pagaloma-Studio/Open-Beta-Lycans/blob/main/Lycans-beta-1-0-setup.exe?raw=true) the installer
2. Execute the installer. If Windows tries to warn you, this is actually normal, as our application is not signed yet. However, the installation is completely safe, as you can see on our [VirusTotal test](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/26288ca51d76019c3fc15ae283655c55d5e339ac3ee97266aa45c3ae31811bf3?nocache=1). If you want to test yourself, make sure the checksum of the binary is :
```
26288ca51d76019c3fc15ae283655c55d5e339ac3ee97266aa45c3ae31811bf3
```
or MD5 :
```
E521C184D88ACEE9ECB5E5F07347598F
```
3. Follow the steps on the installer.
4. That's it ! If you want to uninstall Lycans, simply go where you installed it, and run `unins000.exe`
